### Group Project: Team Agreement

The first step in project planning is establishing a Team Agreement. This will be used as the guideline for how your team will collaborate during project week
Projects are stressful, and can ignite emotions that otherwise wouldn’t be a problem. It’s important that the safety and security of the group comes first, and that an agreement is in place to establish expectations and accountability among the whole group. Planning Schedule a 1-hour meeting for your entire project team. Use this time to review the Team Agreement requirements below, and establish consensus on how to handle each requirement. Deliverables: Start a public-facing GitHub markdown file, and include the following components in your team agreement submission. Cooperation Plan
Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member

#### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

- Mary: Comfortable with most aspects of the frontend, familiar with React

- Luis: Good with backend, comfortable with testing and AWS products.
- Tim: Backend, database manipulation with CRUD operations.
- Tyler: Good with layout, design, styling, creative problem solving, still learning react
- Robert: React/State management, database architecture, data modeling

#### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

##### Identify team leads through all stages of the project (Subject Matter Expert)

- Tyler: Design role, Pair programming,
- Stephen:  Pair programming, project management, Trello
- Luis: Pair program in the backend or testing
- Mary: Project management, material gathering, documentation

- Stephen: Craft Competency, Results Competency
- Tim: API integration with front end requests, styling (css stuffs…)
- Luis: Writing competency, React in general
- Tyler: React competency, state passing and management
- Robert: Craft, communication competencies

#### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

- Morning Stand Up:
- Are there any merges outstanding
- Git pull origin main to make sure we’re in the same place
- Plan the timeline based on the structure of the project
- Check in before and after lunch to make sure the team is aligned
- Check if there are any merges
- Merge branches often so we are coordinated and nothing changes too drastically.
- Git pull origin main at the end of the working day
- 9am - 6 pm PST working day
- Take breaks when needed

NOTE: Undoing, Redoing, Replacing, or otherwise steamrolling the project as an individual is considered to be unacceptable. Account for the inevitable divergence of ideas, execution tasks, and assignments of duties here

#### Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary

##### Describe at least:

What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- Open communication: Honest, clear, feeling comfortable taking risks to clear the air, no grudges
- Timeouts - Walk away when things get heated so they don’t escalate
- Grab another member to mediate in the group
- Team vote on major decisions
- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
- Respectfully draw their attention to the behavior and give them an opportunity to wrap up their thoughts.
- Hand off the conversation to another person.

How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Ask questions
- Preschool mindset - continuous learning
- Be cool

How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- Open communication
- Be direct with that person

How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?
If / when conflict starts to affect the project timeline:

- Tribal Council
- Consult Ryan

#### Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up

What hours will you be available to communicate?

- Mary: M-F 9am-11pm PST
- Stephen: Sun-Sat 8:00 a.m. PST - 11:00 pm PST
- Tim: M-F 9am-9pm PST (scattered throughout weekend)
- Luis: M-F 8:00 a.m. PST - 11:00 pm PST
- Tyler: M-F 8:00 a.m. PST - 11:00 pm PST

What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Mary: Slack, Phone (although very responsive on slack), email(also very responsive)
- Stephen: Slack (for group chat), Phone: 425-301-9603 (immediate chat) Text (Respond within 2 hours), (email: for larger docs, collateral materials, and items that are larger than a chat/text. Responds within 24 hours)
- Tim: Slack (it's on my phone with notifications)
- Luis: Slack or Phone
- Tyler: Slack or Phone
- Robert: Slack or Phone 

How often will you take breaks?

- As needed

What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Communication
- Utilize TA support
- Reach out to Ryan
- Focus on the MVP - SIMPLIFY FROM THE START

How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

- Slack for things that can be handled by anyone in the group when we return to work, or asap
- Text: For things that can be responded to within an hour
- Call: For immediate emergency communication

What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

- Preschool mindset

How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

- Genuine/natural conversation

#### Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts

How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

- Project manager: Stephen will submit to Ryan for the group.

- Morning standup:

1. Daily standup: 10-15 minutes
2. What did you do yesterday?  (60 seconds)
3. What are you working on today? (60 seconds)
4. Any blockers? (60 seconds)

- End of day huddle

1. Daily standup: 10-15 minutes
2. What did you do today?  (60 seconds)
3. What are you working on tomorrow? (60 seconds)
4. Any blockers? (60 seconds)

What project management tool will be used?

- Slack: for team communication
- Google Docs: for planning and file management (like this doc), pres deck
- Project Management Tool: Trello or Git hub - TBD
- Whiteboard tool: Figma
- Github: for collateral materials, Google docs folder for 401 Midterm (i.e., pics, etc.)

#### Presentation Deck

Make a single copy of the Presentation Deck Template. Share your copy with all team members, so everyone is working from the same file. Link to the shared doc in your project plan. Google Doc Slide
Schedule your practice session - Stephen will talk to Ryan to schedule this - TBD
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule a date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team

#### Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks

What components of your project will live on GitHub?

- Organization/Repositories/Assets(except for the assets that live in the team’s Google Folder)

How will you share the repository with your teammates?

- Merge early and often and on schedule
- Anytime we have a working piece of the project, we should seek to merge.

What is your Git flow?

- Branch on individual branch (‘name-feature’)
- Git Pull Origin Main to sync branches
- Merge and Pull request when we have working code
- Git pull origin main to sync branches

Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider

- How many people must review a PR? 2
- Who merges PRs? Subject matter expert & person who wrote the code (alt. PM)
- How often will you merge? Anytime we have working code for a piece of the project
- How will you communicate that it’s time to merge? - Video chat in Remo.
